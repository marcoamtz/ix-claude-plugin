# tests/mock-ix.sh — Mock ix binary for hook testing.
#
# Intercepts ix CLI calls and returns fixture JSON based on the subcommand.
# Default fixtures live in tests/fixtures/ix_outputs/; override per-subcommand
# via env vars so the test harness can set different fixtures per test case.
#
# Env overrides:
#   IX_MOCK_TEXT_FILE      — path to fixture for `ix text`     (default: text_results.json)
#   IX_MOCK_LOCATE_FILE    — path to fixture for `ix locate`   (default: locate_resolved.json)
#   IX_MOCK_OVERVIEW_FILE  — path to fixture for `ix overview` (default: overview_normal.json)
#   IX_MOCK_IMPACT_FILE    — path to fixture for `ix impact`   (default: impact_high.json)
#   IX_MOCK_INVENTORY_FILE — path to fixture for `ix inventory`(default: inventory_results.json)
#   IX_MOCK_BRIEFING_FILE  — path to fixture for `ix briefing` (default: briefing.json)
#   IX_MOCK_FAIL=1         — exit 1 for all data-returning commands (simulates ix failure)
