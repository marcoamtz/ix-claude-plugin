Check `command -v ix` first. If unavailable, use Grep + Read to manually assess blast radius per target.

## Pro check (optional)

Run once at the start:
```bash
ix briefing --format json 2>&1
```
If it returns JSON with a `revision` field, Pro is available. Extract `activeGoals`, `activePlans`, and `openBugs` for use in Pro steps below. If it errors, skip all **[Pro]** labeled steps.

## Goal

Answer: *in what order should these changes be made, what will break, and what needs testing?*

## Phase 1 — Scope (always)

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains symbol names, proceed.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is a description (no identifiable symbols), first run:
```bash
ix text "$ARGUMENTS" --limit 10 --format json
ix locate "$ARGUMENTS" --format json
```
Identify the 1–4 most relevant symbols and treat those as targets.

## Phase 2 — Impact per target (parallel)

For each identified target, run simultaneously:
```bash
ix impact  <target> --format json
ix callers <target> --limit 10 --format json
```

Rank targets by risk level: critical > high > medium > low.

**Fast path — all low risk:** If every target is `low` risk AND has < 3 dependents, skip Phases 3–5. Go directly to Output with verdict "SAFE — all targets low risk; no additional data-flow, shared-dependent, or project-context analysis needed."

**Delegation gate — high-complexity path:** If the fast path did not trigger, check for high complexity:

1. From Phase 2 results: does any target have **dependents > 20**?
2. If not already known, run `ix subsystems --format json` (reads cached data — cheap) and check if any non-low-risk target's region has **coupling > 5**
3. If either condition is true:
   - Spawn `ix-safe-refactor-planner` with pre-filled context:
     - **TARGETS**: the resolved symbol list from Phase 1
     - **RISK_TABLE**: the ranked table from Phase 2 (agent skips its own Steps 1–3)
     - **SUBSYSTEMS**: subsystems JSON from step 2
   - Stop — the agent produces the full sequenced plan

Otherwise continue inline with Phases 3–5.

## Phase 3 — Data flow (only if 2+ targets AND at least one is medium/high/critical)

Find how the targets connect:
```bash
ix trace <highest-risk-target> --to <second-target> --format json
```

Run for the most architecturally significant pair. Skip if targets are in independent subsystems.

## Phase 4 — Shared dependents (only if high/critical targets exist; skip if all low risk)

```bash
ix depends <highest-risk-target> --depth 2 --format json
```

Identify if any third symbol depends on multiple targets (shared blast radius — highest testing priority).

## Phase 5 — Project context and plan tracking **[Pro]**

If Pro is available (detected above):

Check for existing plans and goals that overlap with this change:
```bash
ix plans --format json
ix goals --format json
```

Cross-reference `activePlans` from the briefing to avoid duplicate work. If an existing plan covers these targets, reference it. If `activeGoals` exist, note which goal this change serves.

At the end of the output, suggest the user create a plan to track execution:
```
ix plan create "<change title>" --goal <goal-id>
```
(Only suggest if no existing plan already covers this work.)

## Output

```
# Change Plan

## Targets & Risk

| Target | Risk | Dependents | Key Callers |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|
| <A>    | high | 12         | X, Y, Z     |
| <B>    | low  | 2          | P           |

## Change Order

Edit in this sequence to minimize breakage:
1. [target] — [reason: lowest risk / most-depended-upon first]
2. ...

## Data Flow
[A → trace path → B — or "targets are independent"]

## Shared Risk
[Symbols affected by changes to multiple targets — these need testing after every change]

## Test Checkpoints
After [target A]: verify [specific callers]
After [target B]: verify [specific callers]

## Red Flags
- [any critical/high target needing extra care]
- [any cross-subsystem boundary being crossed]

## Project context **[Pro]**
- Goal this serves: [from ix goals — omit if Pro unavailable]
- Existing plan to track against: [plan ID + title, or "none — suggest creating one"]
```

Do not read source code in this skill unless a target cannot be resolved by `ix locate`.
