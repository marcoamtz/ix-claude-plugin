# ix-claude-plugin

A Claude Code plugin that makes Claude always use [Ix Memory](https://github.com/ix-infrastructure/IX-Memory) for codebase understanding — injecting session context on every prompt, intercepting all searches and file reads with graph-aware queries, and keeping the Ix graph current as Claude edits.

## Installation

```
/plugin marketplace add ix-infrastructure/ix-claude-plugin
/plugin install ix-memory
```

Restart Claude Code after installing.

## Requirements

- [Ix Memory](https://github.com/ix-infrastructure/IX-Memory) installed and running (`ix status` returns ok)
- `jq` in PATH
- `ripgrep` (`rg`) in PATH

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install jq ripgrep

# macOS
brew install jq ripgrep
```

**Ix Pro** is optional. All skills and hooks work with basic ix. If ix pro is installed, the session briefing hook (`ix-briefing.sh`) will additionally inject goals, bugs, and decisions at the start of each prompt.

## What It Does

### Automatic hooks

| Trigger | Hook | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| User sends any prompt | `UserPromptSubmit` → `ix-briefing.sh` | Injects session briefing (goals, bugs, decisions) once per 10 min — **requires ix pro** |
| Claude runs `Grep` or `Glob` | `PreToolUse` → `ix-intercept.sh` | Front-runs with `ix text` + `ix locate`/`ix inventory` |
| Claude runs `Read` | `PreToolUse` → `ix-read.sh` | Front-runs with `ix inventory` + `ix overview` for the file |
| Claude runs `Bash` with grep/rg | `PreToolUse` → `ix-bash.sh` | Extracts pattern, front-runs with `ix text` + `ix locate` |
| Claude edits a file | `PostToolUse` → `ix-ingest.sh` (async) | Runs `ix map <file>` to update the graph for the changed file |
| Claude finishes responding | `Stop` → `ix-map.sh` (async) | Runs `ix map` to refresh the full architectural graph |

All hooks bail silently if `ix` is not in PATH or the backend is unreachable.

### Skills (slash commands)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ix-search <term>` | Graph-aware search combining `ix text` + `ix locate` |
| `/ix-explain <symbol>` | Explain what a symbol does using `ix explain` |
| `/ix-impact <target>` | Analyze blast radius of changing a symbol or file |
| `/ix-trace <symbol>` | Trace the execution flow or call chain for a symbol |
| `/ix-smells [path]` | Detect code smells and structural issues |
| `/ix-understand [target]` | Full architectural overview of a subsystem, module, or the whole repo |
| `/ix-investigate <symbol>` | Deep investigation chaining explain → trace → depends → callers → impact |
| `/ix-depends <symbol>` | Show the full upstream dependency tree |
| `/ix-diff <fromRev> <toRev>` | Show structural changes between two graph revisions |
| `/ix-plan <symbol> [...]` | Risk-annotated change plan for multi-file implementations |
| `/ix-before-edit <target>` | Pre-edit safety check — impact + callers + overview |
| `/ix-read <symbol>` | Read just a symbol's source (resolves to exact file:lines) |
| `/ix-subsystems [target]` | Explore the architectural map — systems, subsystems, cohesion metrics |

All skills fall back gracefully when ix is unavailable — using Grep, Glob, and Read tools instead where possible.

### Agent

The `ix-explorer` sub-agent is available for deep codebase exploration tasks. Claude will automatically delegate to it when exploring unfamiliar code, tracing data flows, or assessing change impact. It uses ix commands exclusively before falling back to native tools.

## Uninstall

```
/plugin uninstall ix-memory
```
